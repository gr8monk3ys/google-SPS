      <p> I am Lorenzo Scaturchio, I am currently and undergraduate Computer Science
          major at the University of California, Merced. My main interests lie in the
          clubs that I am apart of such as one called HackMerced where we are running our
          very own hackathon, as well as the job that I am currently working on
          which involves optimizing for hydropower facilities using python.

      <p>One hidden talent that I have is that I can play multiple instruments. I have
          been in a band before and I used to play the guitar, but I was also able to play
          the bass, keyboard, ukulele, and mandolin.
